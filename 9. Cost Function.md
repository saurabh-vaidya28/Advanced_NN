a cost function (often referred to as a loss function) is a mathematical function that measures how well the neural network's predictions match the actual target values. In simple terms, it quantifies the "error" or difference between the predicted output of the network and the expected output (or true label).

The goal during training a neural network is to minimize the cost function, which improves the accuracy of the network's predictions.
