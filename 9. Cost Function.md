A cost function (often referred to as a loss function) is a mathematical function that measures how well the neural network's predictions match the actual target values. In simple terms, it quantifies the "error" or difference between the predicted output of the network and the expected output (or true label).

The goal during training a neural network is to minimize the cost function, which improves the accuracy of the network's predictions.

Types of Cost Functions:
The type of cost function used depends on the problem you're trying to solve (e.g., classification or regression).

1. Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Used for: Regression problems (where the output is continuous, like predicting a number).

- The function calculates the average squared difference between actual and predicted values. Minimizing the MSE leads to the network predicting values closer to the actual values.

2. Cross-Entropy Loss (Log Loss)
- Used for: Classification problems, particularly binary and multi-class classification.
- Binary Cross-Entropy (for binary classification):
- Categorical Cross-Entropy (for multi-class classification):
- Cross-entropy measures the difference between two probability distributions: the true labels (usually in one-hot encoded format) and the predicted probabilities. It is widely used in classification tasks because it directly handles probabilities, which is ideal for classification output.

3. Hinge Loss
- Used for: Support Vector Machines (SVMs), but sometimes in neural networks for binary classification problems, especially with support vector-like approaches.
- The hinge loss function penalizes incorrect classifications, with a margin of "1". It's typically used in classifiers that try to maximize the margin between different classes.

4. Huber Loss
- Used for: Regression problems that are less sensitive to outliers than MSE.
- Huber loss combines the properties of MSE (for small errors) and absolute error (for large errors). It's robust to outliers because it behaves quadratically for smaller errors and linearly for larger ones, reducing the impact of extreme outliers.

### How Neural Networks Use Cost Functions:
- Forward Pass: During the forward pass of training, the neural network takes the input data and computes predictions through layers of neurons.

- Compute Loss: Once the network has produced predictions, the cost function computes the loss by comparing these predictions to the actual target values.

- Backpropagation: The loss is then propagated backward through the network using backpropagation to adjust the weights of the neurons, with the goal of reducing the loss. This process uses gradient descent (or variants) to minimize the cost function.

### Optimizing the Cost Function:
The main goal of training a neural network is to minimize the cost function using optimization techniques like Gradient Descent. The optimization process updates the parameters (weights) of the network based on the gradient (the derivative of the cost function with respect to the weights), helping the network "learn" from the data.
