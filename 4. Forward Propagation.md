## 1. What is forward propagation in a neural network?
Answer: Forward propagation is the process through which input data passes through the network to generate an output. It involves computing the weighted sum of inputs at each layer, adding a bias, applying an activation function, and passing the result to the next layer. The final output layer produces the network's prediction.<br>
The steps are:<b>
        - Compute the weighted sum of inputs.
        - Add bias.
        - Apply an activation function (like ReLU, Sigmoid, etc.).
        - Repeat for all layers.
        - Output the final prediction (in classification, usually through a sigmoid or softmax function).
