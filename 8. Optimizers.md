### 1. What is the role of an optimizer in a neural network?
Answer: An optimizer’s role in a neural network is to update the network's weights during training by minimizing the loss function. The optimizer adjusts the weights based on the gradients (calculated via backpropagation), ensuring the network moves toward better performance with each iteration. By doing so, the optimizer helps the network learn from data and generalize well to unseen data.

The optimizer’s role is to find the best combination of weights and biases that leads to the most accurate predictions.

### Gradient Descent
Gradient Descent is a popular optimization method for training machine learning models. It works by iteratively adjusting the model parameters in the direction that minimizes the loss function.

Key Steps in Gradient Descent

1. Initialize parameters: Randomly initialize the model parameters.
2. Compute the gradient: Calculate the gradient (derivative) of the loss function with respect to the parameters.
3. Update parameters: Adjust the parameters by moving in the opposite direction of the gradient, scaled by the learning rate.

### Variants of Gradient Descent:

#### 1. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) updates the model parameters after each training example, making it more efficient for large datasets compared to traditional Gradient Descent, which uses the entire dataset for each update.

Steps:
1. Select a training example.
2. Compute the gradient of the loss function.
3. Update the model parameters.

- Advantages: Requires less memory and may find new minima.
- Disadvantages: Noisier, requiring more iterations to converge.

#### 2. Mini Batch Stochastic Gradient Descent
Mini-batch stochastic gradient descent consists of a predetermined number of training examples, smaller than the full dataset. This approach combines the advantages of the previously mentioned variants. In one epoch, following the creation of fixed-size mini-batches, we execute the following steps:

1. Select a mini-batch.
2. Compute the mean gradient of the mini-batch.
3. Apply the mean gradient obtained in step 2 to update the model's weights.
4. Repeat steps 1 to 2 for all the mini-batches that have been created.

- Advantages: Requires medium amount of memory and less time required to converge when compared to SGD
- Disadvantage: May get stuck at local minima

#### 3. SGD with Momentum
Momentum helps accelerate convergence by smoothing out the noisy gradients of SGD, thus reducing fluctuations and improving the speed of convergence.

- Advantages: Mitigates oscillations, reduces variance, and faster convergence.
- Disadvantages: Requires tuning the momentum coefficient β.

### Advanced Optimizers

#### 1. AdaGrad (Adaptive Gradient Algorithm)
AdaGrad adapts the learning rate for each parameter based on the historical gradient information. The learning rate decreases over time, making AdaGrad effective for sparse features.

- Advantages: Adapts the learning rate, improving training efficiency.
- Disadvantages: Learning rate decays too quickly, causing slow convergence.

#### 2. RMSProp (Root Mean Square Propagation)
RMSProp improves upon AdaGrad by introducing a decay factor to prevent the learning rate from decreasing too rapidly.

- Advantages: Prevents excessive decay of learning rates.
- Disadvantages: Computationally expensive due to the additional parameter.

#### 3. Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation)
Adam combines the advantages of Momentum and RMSProp. It uses both the first moment (mean) and second moment (variance) of gradients to adapt the learning rate for each parameter.

- Advantages: Fast convergence.
- Disadvantages: Requires significant memory due to the need to store first and second moment estimates.
