### 1. What is an activation function in a neural network?
Answer:
- An activation function in a neural network is a mathematical function applied to the output of each neuron or node in a layer, transforming the input signal into an output signal.
- Its purpose is to introduce non-linearity into the network, enabling it to learn complex patterns and relationships in data.
- Without activation functions, the neural network would behave like a linear model, regardless of how many layers it has, and would be unable to solve non-linear problems.
