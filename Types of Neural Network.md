## Types of Neural Network:

### 1) Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN):
The simplest type of neural network where data moves in one direction from input layer to output layers with no cycles or loops. They are used for tasks like classification and regression. 

<br>

### 2) Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): 
Primarily used for image processing tasks. They contain convolutional layers that apply filters to extract feature from images, followed by pooling layers for down-sampling and fully connected layers for classification.

### 3) Recurrent Newal Networks (RNN):
Designed for sequential data (e.g., time series or text), where connection between neurons form cycles, allowing the network to retrain memory of previous input. RNNs are suitable for tasks like language modeling, Speech recognition etc.

<br>

### 4) Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM): 
A type of RNN that is designed to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data by using special units called memory cells that can store information over time.

<br>

### 5) Genrative Adversarial Network (GAN):
Consits of two network, a generator that creates fake data and discrimination that tries to differentiate between real & fake data. These networks are used for tasks like image generation, Style transfer etc.

<br>

### 6) Auteencoders:
Unsupervised neural network used for tasks like data compression and feature learning. They consist of an encoder that compresses the data and a decoder that reconstructs it.

### 7) Tramfarmer Network:
Used primarily for NLP tasks, transformer rely on self attention mechanism to process sequences of data, offering advantage over RNN & LSTMs, especially for task like machine translation, language modeling etc.
